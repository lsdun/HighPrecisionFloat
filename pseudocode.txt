create an empty list for each decimal place
tenths = []
hundredths = []
thousandths = []
etc...

we have two numbers:
num_string = [1.234, 2.345]

then we need to locate where the decimal point is located:
for i in num_string:
    s_num = str(i)
    if '.' in s_num:
        n = s_num.index('.')
        print(n)

then if we know where the decimal place is, we can identify the values surrounding the decimal:
s_num[n-1] = ones place
s_num[n-2] = tens place
s_num[n-3] = hundreds place

* append zeros to the places we need 
* comparisons of greater than or equal to or less than
