create an empty list for each decimal place
tenths = []
hundredths = []
thousandths = []
etc...

we have two numbers:
num_string = [1.234, 2.345]

then we need to locate where the decimal point is located:
for i in num_string:
    if '.' in num_string
    return s_num.index('.')

* append zeros to the places we need 
* comparisons of greater than or equal to or less than
